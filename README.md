# Personal User Manual 
🙋‍♂️ Hello there. Nice to have you here reading this manual on how to deal with me. The aim is to provide a little sneak peek into my crazy head and help you understand how I would be as a co-worker.

## Conditions I like to work in 🖥
- I get very easily distracted, so I try to not hear conversation when working
- I aspire for a clean desk, but it is seldom so
- I like to have one Mate Mate a day before 2 pm


## The times/Hours I like to work 🕰
- I will be available between 10am to 4pm always. Some days I like to start working at 7 am and others I'm content with starting at 10 am.
- I like blocking times to do focussed work so keep an eye out on that calendar when you book a meeting with me.

## The best ways to communicate with me 📬
- I'm a big fan of async communication. 
- When not possible to have async communication, I like having video calls with the camera switched ON
- Please try to schedule meetings rather than having them ad-hoc

## The ways I like to receive feedback ⚡️
- I like to the point feedback. Please don't sugarcoat it. I get confused by this
- I would appreciate if you include a specific example

## Things I need ✔️
- I like having time to research something before forming an opinion about it
- I love having idea sessions but atleast I should know what we will discuss
- I only want to have discussions in good faith. If I sense a discussion is only happening to soothe someone's ego, I will withdraw

## Things I struggle with 🙀
- Sometimes I focus too much on the meta-work instead of the actual work
- I hate using will power. I'll take habits over will power any day
- Self-confidence. 

## Things I love ❤️
- Pair/mob programming
- Snowboarding to an extent
- My family :)

## Other things to know about me

### I ask a lot of questions 🗣
I ask questions just to clarify. It sometimes seems like I'm trying to undermine the idea ro trying to give you a hard time. But I'm just trying to assess the situation. So, saying "I don't know" is a perfectly valid response to my questions.

### Strong opinions loosely held 🥸
I will believe in something for a long time until I get a good argument against it. If I get the argument, I will instantly switch my opinion. This can be jarring.
